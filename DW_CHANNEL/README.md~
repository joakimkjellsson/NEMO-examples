CHANNEL
=======

This test case closely resembles the case in Danilov and Wang (2015, doi:10.1016/j.ocemod.2015.07.006). The grid is a re-entrant channel of 1800 km width and 3600 km length at 30 km resolution and flat bottom with 1600 m depth. The initial state is at rest with constant salinity and temperature gradients dT/dy = -5e-6 K/m and dT/dz = 8e-3 K/m. Initial noise on SSH is also added. A relaxation of temperature to the initial state is added within 165 km of the northern and southern boundary at a rate of 1e-6 s-1, corresponding to roughly 11 days. 

It serves as a benchmark for studying geostrophic turbulence in eddy-permitting models and can be used to e.g. evaluate viscosity and drag parameters.

Temperature is given by T(x,y,z) = y * dTdy + z * dTdz + T0, where T0 = 25 degC, dTdy = -5e-6 K/m, dTdz = 8e-3 K/m. Salinity is constant 30 g/kg and velocities are zero. 
A simplified equation of state is used with thermal expansion coefficient 2.5e-4 K-1. 
The channel is re-entrant with 3600 km lenght and 1800 km width, with 30 km resolution. Depth is 1600 m (flat bottom) with dz =
